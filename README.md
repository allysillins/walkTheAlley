# :walking: Walk The Alley :walking:

Walk the Alley is a tool (and pun on my name :wink: )
for tracking what % of streets and alleys in my neighborhood 
I've walked. I plan to use the strava API for this project, 
since I track all of my long walks on strava. This is my first
time working with an API.
